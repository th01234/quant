Quant is a comprehensive Python toolkit designed for quantitative analysis and strategy development on Bitcoin price data.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Load historical Bitcoin OHLCV data.
   - Preprocess and clean data.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Calculate advanced indicators (EMA, RSI, etc.).
   - Generate rolling statistics.

3. **Machine Learning-Based Signal Generation**
   - Quantile classification of price action.
   - Train XGBoost and neural networks.
   - Hyperparameter optimization.

4. **Risk Modeling**
   - Model future volatility with LASSO regression.
   - Integrate risk predictions into signals.

5. **Walk-Forward Validation**
   - Out-of-sample testing and signal refinement.

6. **Strategy Backtesting**
   - Simulate trades and manage risk/money.
   - Measure performance (return, Sharpe, drawdown).

7. **Results Analysis**
   - Visualize portfolio performance.
   - Summarize backtest results.

The modular design enables rigorous research and systematic Bitcoin trading strategy development.
